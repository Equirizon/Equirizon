# 🛰️ Project Equirizon

> Personal portfolio, but make it feel like a flagship product launch.

Welcome to **Project Equirizon** — not just a developer portfolio, but a hyper-curated experience designed to present _myself_ (Brandon Bustria)
Built from scratch using modern web tech with speed, clarity, and vibes in mind.

Think of it as:  
👨‍💻 **Software Dev.**  
🎵 **Music Maker.**  
🏋️ **Iron Pusher.**  
But make it interactive, performant, and hosted on the edge.

## 🛠️ Side Projects

### 1. **AI-Powered Discord Bot** _(WIP)_  

An intelligent Discord companion that acts more like a **friend** than a bot.  
Designed to understand natural conversation and handle:

- Dynamic conversations
- Commands without feeling like commands
- Low-key AI assistant functions

Think J.A.R.V.I.S., but with Discord Nitro.

### 2. **Barangay Management System**  

Built for real-world admin use, this full-stack web app powers local barangay ops.  
Live at: [barangay-system-website.vercel.app](https://barangay-system-website.vercel.app)
