          I've always been obsessed with how things are made, whether it's a UI, a song, or even circuits on a
          breadboard. My creative journey started with design tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, where I'd spend
          hours making logos, banners, and icons. I had this personal rule: “Only use original work.” That mindset
          pushed me to learn everything myself and take pride in what I created, visuals that I could fully call mine.

          My first spark for web development came in high school. We were introduced to HTML, and before our teacher
          could even get to CSS, I was already deep into keyframes and animations. While others were submitting basic
          static pages, I was building flashy, interactive layouts after class for fun. That thrill of seeing something
          come alive on screen, that's what hooked me. Despite my roots in design, I see myself primarily as a
          developer. It might sound ironic, but while I love aesthetics, I'm more wired for engineering. I even spent
          time tinkering with Arduino microcontrollers, wiring up sensors and displays just to understand how things
          work beneath the surface. That curiosity for systems naturally bled into how I write code, always digging a
          little deeper, always trying to connect the dots.

          What energizes me most is watching an idea from my head take shape in the browser. Nothing beats the moment
          when design and function click. And when things break? That just means it's not done yet.

          I'll admit, creativity doesn't always come easy for me. I struggle to invent things from scratch, but I care
          deeply about how things look, feel, and behave. Maybe that's why front-end development feels like home: it's
          the balance of logic and aesthetics, of math and meaning.
        </p>

          Outside of coding, I've also branched into music production, another creative outlet that lets me design not
          just visually, but in terms of materializing dreams. It's like the same mindset, just translated into sound.

          Right now, I'm actively looking for work, particularly roles that let me bring strong UI/UX ideas to life in
          real-world products. <br />I recently built and deployed a full-stack Barangay Management Web App using
          Next.js and Supabase, which you can check out <a href='https://barangay-system-website.vercel.app/'>
